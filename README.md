# Christie-Data-Scrape

This project was an excerise in scraping Christie's Website to be able to see how Christie Auctions off items, in what locations, and 
the distubation of them throughout their locations. 

Through multiple scraping of the data using BS4 and Selenium I was able to collect data on the auction Christie hosted plus the amount of items sold at each event. After checking for accuracy and cleaning it so they can be made into graphs to easily show some trends in how Christie operates.
