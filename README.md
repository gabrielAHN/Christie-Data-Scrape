# Christie-Data-Scrape

This project was an excerise in scraping Christie's Website to be able to see how Christie Auctions off items through the data I was able to collect. 

Through multiple scraping of the data using BS4 and Selenium I was able to collect data on the auction Christie hosted plus the amount of items sold at each event. After checking for accuracy and cleaning it so they can be made into graphs to easily show some trends in how Christie operates.

Then I went deeper by using Selenium to collect the amount of Art work each house sold. Through this deeper scraper, I needed to check for null value to be able to know the data was accurate. Then cleaning that data to create graphs of them.
